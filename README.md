Goal: create a website that searches through a currated collection of tutorials to reliably re-access information on a topic

Let's say im looking for a tutorial on music production, but there are hundreds of tutorials, most of which aren't very helpful. When i do find the perfect one, I can store it in the collection so that the next time I need information on the subject, I know that this tutorial is the best one and i don't have to re-find it.


## TODO
"upload page": submit a [title, source link, description, and keywords] to a tutorial and upload it to the database
